    TODO: better way to display lines that did not have an exact match
        
    IMPROVE MATCHING ALGORTIHM
    TODO: consider using sheet_to_json (to get a 2D array)
    TODO: cleanup loading code (raw preview)
    TODO: for lines that do not have an exact match we should match them by best partial match
    TODO: compare all sheets (for now assume sheets are in same order)
    TODO: show matches (perfect, near perfect, best, near best)

    HASHING ALGORTIHM
    TODO: might need a bettter hash function (murmur3?)  

    BUGS
    TODO: input file button on cancel clears currently selected file - I added code that ignores that but that means we have no way to deselect something
    TODO: if we do not have two files selected either 
            -> the compare button should not be clickable (w/tooltip explanation) or
            -> improve the error message and we probably shouldn't use an alert
    TODO: if displayRaw is unchecked, raw output will not be replaced when a new file is loaded
    TODO: near perfect vs duplicates, one of the 70's didn't match up -- need to rematch left side if the left is not the right side's best match
